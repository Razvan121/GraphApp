   🧩GraphApp

GraphApp is an educational and interactive application for exploring and understanding graph algorithms.
It allows users to run and visualize the step-by-step execution of classic algorithms on various types of graphs — directed, undirected, weighted, or unweighted.


 🚀 Features

🔹 Create and edit graphs – add or remove nodes and edges

🔹 Choose graph type – directed / undirected / weighted

🔹 Run popular graph algorithms, including:

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

 🧠 How It Works

Load or create a graph from scratch

Select an algorithm from the menu

Watch the algorithm run step by step, with visual highlights of visited nodes, edges, and current distances

Analyze the result interactively (paths, costs, connected components, etc.)

 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

Frontend: TypeScript, HTML, CSS

Backend / logic: Python (or the relevant language you used)

Graph visualization: (e.g., D3.js, vis.js, or custom)

Other libraries / frameworks: (list here any major ones)

Browser: works in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)


 🎓 Educational Purpose

GraphApp is designed as a learning tool for students, educators, and anyone interested in understanding how graph algorithms work.
Each algorithm can be visualized step by step, making it easier to grasp concepts like traversal, shortest paths, and connectivity.
